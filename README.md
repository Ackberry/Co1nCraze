This bot was made by Deep Akbari, with help of Perplexity AI (mainly GPT-4o)

The bot is very basic, only comprising of two functions (news & price). 
It is hosted on Linode.

IMPORTANT**
You would need to download the required libraries in order to run this bot(or make your own):
1. python-telegram-bot
2. requests
3. apscheduler (optional, I had a feature I was interested to add but then decided the opposite)


The bot is hosted 24/7 in Linode from now on. (I was confused on why was my system shutting down even when it showed 'running' in Linode).

If you need any kind of help, you can reach out at youngbari@proton.me
